# FlashCards-Udacity Refactor
This is a Project made for the React Nano-degree program using react-native

## TL-DR
Before starting this project you *must* update the dependencies by means of a script added to the **package.json**
```
npm run reset
```

this will refresh the dependencies that may or may not cause problems, after that
```
npm install
```

then just run it
```
npm start
```
